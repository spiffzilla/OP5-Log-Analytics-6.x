In the upper right corner there is a section in which it defines the

After clicking this selection, we can adjust the scope of search by
selecting one of the three tabs in the drop-down window:

- **Quick**: contain several predefined ranges that should be clicked.
- **Relative**: in this windows specify the day from which OP5 Log Analytics should search for data.
- **Absolute**: using two calendars we define the time range for which the search results are to be returned.
